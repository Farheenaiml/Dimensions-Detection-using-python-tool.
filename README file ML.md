# 📏 Dimensions Detection using Python Tool

---

## 🧠 **Project Overview**

This tool uses Python and OpenCV to estimate the real-world dimensions (in centimeters) of a target rectangular object (e.g., a box, book) in an image by comparing it to a known-size reference object (e.g., a credit card).  
It processes a single image and outputs the target's width and height, both visually and in text.

---

## 📦 **Dependencies Explained**

This project relies on a few essential Python libraries:

### 1. 🧰 **OpenCV (`opencv-python`)**
- **Purpose**: Core library for image loading, processing, edge detection, contour detection, drawing rectangles, text annotations, and image saving.  
- **Installation**:  
  ```
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

### 2. 📊 **Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)**
- **Purpose**: Used for displaying the final annotated image with accurate dimension labels. OpenCV’s native `imshow()` may not work consistently across platforms, hence matplotlib is used.  
- **Installation**:  
  ```
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

### 3. 🔢 **NumPy (`numpy`)**
- **Purpose**: Required by OpenCV for internal array handling and numerical operations, even if not used directly in the code.  
- **Installation**:  
  ```
  pip install numpy
  ```

✅ **Install all together**:
```
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

## 🛠️ **How to Run the Script**

---

### 📁 **Folder Structure**

```
measure_dimensions_project/
├── measure_rect.py               # Main Python script
├── sample_images/
│   └── Image_refn.jpeg           # Input image containing reference + target
├── annotated_box_dimensions.jpg # Output image (auto-saved)
└── README.md                     # This file
```

---

### 💻 **Command-Line Instructions**

1. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal**

2. **Navigate to your project folder**:
```
cd Downloads/measure_dimensions_project
```

3. **Run the script with the image as an argument**:
```
python measure_rect.py sample_images/Image_refn.jpeg
```

---

### 🧪 **How to run in VS Code**

1. Open Terminal:  
```
python measure_rect.py sample_images/Image_refn.jpeg
```

---

### 📤 **Sample Terminal Output**

```
Total contours found: 354
Detected rectangles: 2
Scale: 0.0103 cm/pixel
Box Dimensions (real-world): Width = 14.88 cm, Height = 11.72 cm
```

✅ The output image `annotated_box_dimensions.jpg` will show the target object with red-labeled real-world dimensions.

---

## 📐 **How to Specify the Reference Dimensions**

To accurately estimate the dimensions of the target object, you must first specify the real-world width (in centimeters) of the reference object in the image.

---

### 💳 **Common Reference**: Credit Card

If you're using a credit card as your reference object (which is standard size), its width is **8.56 cm**. This is already specified in the code like this:

```python
ref_width_cm = 8.56  # Real-world width of the reference object in cm
```

---

### 📏 **Using a Different Reference Object?**

You can use any flat, rectangular object with known dimensions, such as:

- A business card
- A printed label
- A small book
- A ruler or scale

Just measure the actual width in centimeters of the reference object, and update the line in the script:

```python
ref_width_cm = 7.0  # Replace with your object's real width in cm
```

> ⚠️ Only the width is required in the script because the width in pixels is used to calculate the scale (`cm_per_pixel`). Make sure the reference object is placed flat and fully visible in the image.

---

## 📌 **Notes and Assumptions**

- The script assumes the **reference object is the smallest detected valid rectangle**.
- The next largest rectangle is assumed to be the **target**.
- We can adjust the thresholds for area and aspect ratio in the contour loop to suit different objects/images.

---

## 🖼️ **Output Image Example**

After running the script, you will find an annotated image like this:  
✅ `annotated_box_dimensions.jpg`

It will show:

- The **target object** in a ✅ green rectangle  
- The **real-world dimensions** in 🟥 red text above it
